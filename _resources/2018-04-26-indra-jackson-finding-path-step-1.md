### Step 1: CHANGE or REGRET? It’s your choice…

CHANGE -  can be scary but as the saying goes:
‘If you don’t watch out… you’ll end up where you’re heading!’
Ask yourself: ‘where am I heading right now?’ If you’re reading this..it’s probably not where you want to be going. What is the ultimate worst case scenario of where you will end up if you carry on like you are now? Think it through..what will you be doing and saying to yourself in 5 or 10 years time if everything stays the same?

Wanting to ESCAPE or head AWAY FROM something we don’t like or want is a really powerful motivator. Allow yourself to feel that pain, knowing it’s going to help you… MOVE TOWARDS finding your true self.

REGRET - here’s some food for thought:
The top 5 regrets people have before they die - as noticed by an Australian nurse working daily with the terminally ill:

1.	I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others 	expected of me.
2.	I wish I hadn't worked so much.
3.	I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
4.	I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5.	I wish that I had let myself be happier.

What would you regret right now if you found you had only 12 weeks longer to live?

Take some time to think deeply about this and make a few notes of your insights. It will help you focus and will make fascinating reading in years to come!
